# 🎓 Undergraduate Engineering Projects – Control, Modeling, and System Validation

This folder contains two major undergraduate engineering projects focused on **mechatronic system design**, **control-oriented modeling**, and **simulation-based validation**.

Both projects were conducted as team-based capstone or design courses and emphasize:

- Safety-oriented mechanical–electrical system integration  
- Dynamic modeling and simulation  
- Control algorithm design and tuning  
- Performance comparison under disturbances  
- Validation through quantitative metrics
