# 📄 Undergraduate Journal Paper – Event-Triggered LMI-Based Control and Observer Design for LPV Systems

This folder contains a journal paper written during my undergraduate studies, focusing on **continuous-time Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems** and the design of both **controllers and observers using Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs)** under an **event-triggered control framework**.

This work represents my early research training in fundamental control theory, convex optimization, and validation-driven design, forming a strong technical foundation for my later graduate-level PMSM research.
