# Projects

This directory contains engineering and research projects completed during my graduate studies, with a focus on PMSM systems, observer-based control, and simulation-driven validation.

The projects emphasize independent system modeling, algorithm development, and rigorous performance evaluation for practical motor-control applications.

## 🎯 Project Focus

My master's projects primarily addressed PMSM-driven compressor systems subject to rapidly varying load torque, conducted as part of an industry-sponsored research project with **LG Electronics**.
A key aspect was building complete MATLAB/Simulink simulation environments from scratch to deeply understand system dynamics, and controller–observer interactions.
