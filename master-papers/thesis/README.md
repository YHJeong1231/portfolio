- **Abstract:** This thesis presents an LMI-based neuro-adaptive observer with backpropagation learning for uncertain nonlinear discrete-time systems. The method directly designs the observer in discrete time, avoiding instability from discretization, and uses a single-hidden-layer neural network to approximate unknown dynamics. Stability is guaranteed through Lyapunov analysis and convex LMI optimization, while the number of tuning parameters is reduced by adopting a common observer gain structure. An $H_\infty$ formulation further suppresses approximation errors and measurement noise. Simulations on a PMSM compressor model confirm accurate state and disturbance estimation and demonstrate robustness compared to conventional approaches.
<!-- This thesis proposes a design method for backpropagation- and linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based neuro-adaptive observer for uncertain nonlinear systems in discrete-time domain. The proposed scheme employs a neural network with a single hidden layer to approximate the unknown uncertainties. To avoid divergence risk associated with discretization, the observer is directly formulated and analyzed in the discrete-time domain. A Lyapunov function is constructed to guarantee the stability of both the linear observer and the weight updates of the neural network. The observer gain is determined by solving the LMI conditions, and the design is simplified by minimizing the number of tuning parameters, using a common gain structure for all vertices. Furthermore, designing an $H_\infty$ observer can reduce the effect of neural network approximation error and the measurement noise. In conclusion, the proposed method minimizes the number of tuning parameters, accurately estimates the states and uncertainties, ensures LMI-based stability with backpropagation-based updates, suppresses disturbance effects through $H_\infty$ design, and is directly applicable in the discrete-time domain. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method successfully tracks the actual states and the lumped nonlinear term and reduce the effects of neural network approximation error and the measurement noise with comparison of the root mean square error values. -->
