## 🎯 Research Focus

My graduate research centers on permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) systems, including observer design, neural network–based uncertainty estimation, and simulation-driven validation.

My undergraduate work established a strong foundation in classical and modern control theory, particularly controller and observer design methodologies.
